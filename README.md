Work in progress...


## Hasbro Hackathon Project

You know how as a kid you made up fun games with your own rules? This is a platform to share made-up games with others, share scores, and upvote the best ones. There will be a physical kit as well, one for indoor and one for outdoor, with ingredients, such as board game pieces, nerf balls, etc. Looking for help from designers, developers, and anyone interested.
